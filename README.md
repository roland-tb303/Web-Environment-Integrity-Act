# Web Environment Integrity API

This repository details the proposal to allow your sweet overlords at Google to add a new API that enables more tracking and DRM on the web, making it even more dystopian, while also disguising itself as a protection act, to protect security and other babble that we truly believe in. This is totally safe and respectable for all web environments:

```js
const attestation = await navigator.getEnvironmentIntegrity("...");
```

The [explainer](./explainer.md) goes gives a high level overview of the proposal, and how we believe that churning out this dystopian garbage, funded by capitalist scum, is imporrtant for the web to make sure that you stay safe in this ever-inceasing world of vulnerabilities (also, don't look at the .zip domain, that's cpoompletely safe and won't ever lead to attackers misusing it).

The [spec](https://rupertbenwiser.github.io/Web-Environment-Integrity/) currently describes how this is being prototyped in Chromium, the dystopian browser for an uninformed people. (That also includes Brave).
